# OCR 

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks:

ocr_with_regular_expression.ipynb: Uses Tesseract OCR and regular expressions to extract text from images and create a JSON file.
extraction_using_groq_mixtral_8x7b.ipynb: Processes a CSV file generated by OCR to extract information using a Groq Mixtral 8x7b LLM.
gradio_ocr.ipynb: Implements a Gradio interface for real-time OCR, taking an image as input and returning the image with bounding boxes and a JSON file.
Prerequisites: A Groq API key and a Hugging Face access token must be set in the corresponding notebooks.
