# OCR with Region

## This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks:

1. "ocr_with_regular_expression.ipynb:" Uses Tesseract OCR and regular expressions to extract text from images and create a JSON file.

2. "extraction_using_groq_mixtral_8x7b.ipynb:" Processes a CSV file generated by OCR to extract information using a Groq Mixtral 8x7b LLM.

3. "gradio_ocr.ipynb:" Implements a Gradio interface for real-time OCR, taking an image as input and returning the image with bounding boxes and a JSON file.

"Prerequisites:" A Groq API key and a Hugging Face access token must be set in the corresponding notebooks.
